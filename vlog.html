    <h3> 
        Hi there!<br><br>
        Everyone just calls me Max, even though my name is Massimiliano. I enjoy reading books, whether they are fiction, non-fiction, or even just weird tech-related content. I also adore languages.

        I enjoy speaking English a lot and I'm really good at it. I learned it even more quickly because I went to Canada, the United States, and England. I enjoy making new friends and engaging in lively discussions.

        Writing, talking (a lot!), and coding are some of my favorite pastimes. Music is amazing, so I also really want to learn how to play the drums eventually.

        I have good grades in school, yet I'm still a complete beginner in several topics. I also enjoy cooking because it's enjoyable to prepare food and even more enjoyable to eat it!
