    <h1>Nice to meet you!</h1>

        Hi there!<br><br>
        Hello! So, I'm Max, and I suppose I'll just be discussing my daily routine. It's not particularly exciting...

I don't like waking up early. At the weekends, I sleep in until 9 a.m., or even 10 a.m. if I'm really knackered. But on school days, I have to wake up much earlier, usually around 7 or 7:30 a.m., which is really inconvienient. The first thing I do is eat breakfast or else I am half asleep all morning. Sometimes I shower afterwards but it is depending on how much time I have and my mood.

Then I just sort of do whatever. If I have any leftovers of homework, I try to get it done (or at least enough so that I won't get in trouble). But if I don't, I just kind of game or mess around on my phone. I'm a huge gamer, so if I'm not doing anything, that's probably what I'm doing. I also sort of enjoy cooking, so during lunchtime I'll usually make myself some food. It sometimes turns out good, sometimes. really not, but at least I'm trying.

And yeah, that's the general way my mornings are. The rest of the day is whatever is happening, but I just go with it. Anyway, that's all!
